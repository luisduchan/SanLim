        Established in 2002, San Lim Furniture begins its operations in an approximately 15 hectares of land area, located in Dong Nai Province. Since the beginning of operations, San Lim Furniture has dedicated itself in continuous improvements. We deem that continuous improvements work in 2 directions where customers and vendors could sit together and share critical and constructive feedbacks. Continuous improvements will only mean that we will always move forward for changes to be better a company. Having continuous improvements as our core value, we realize that we are able to understand the needs and requirements of our customers, leading us to closer partnership with our customers such as Ashley Furniture, Rooms To Go, Pottery Barn, American Drew, Havertyâ€™s and many more.

Having continuous improvements as our core value to our customers, we also feel that it is crucial for us to have the same core value to our vendors and our company. Using the same core value to our vendors, we are able to position ourselves strategically by obtaining better raw materials from our suppliers; thus, increasing our initial production capacity from 400 containers/month to 450 containers/month. Similarly, having continuous improvements as our core value in our management system has helped us to decrease our turnover rate and increase employee satisfaction.

Having established in Vietnam for more than 10 years, in 2014, San Lim is undergoing an expansion of approximately 9 hectares of land, which will increase our capacity from 450 containers/month to 650 containers/month. This expansion is believed to finish construction and begin production in mid of 2015. With the addition of new facility, it will include new finishing line that is able to handle water-based paint and PU paint.
